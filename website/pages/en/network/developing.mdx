Learn developer fundamentals and review the basics of a subgraph’s lifecycle. To start coding right away and engage The Graph, go to the following: [Developer Quick Start](/quick-start/)

## Overview

As a developer, you need important data to build and power your dapps. Querying and indexing that blockchain data can be challenging, but The Graph provides a solution to this issue.

On The Graph, you can:

1.  Create, deploy and publish subgraphs to The Graph using **Graph CLI** and [Subgraph Studio](/https://thegraph.com/studio/).
2.  Use Graph node via **GraphQL** to query live subgraphs and power dapps.

### What is GraphQL and Graph CLI?

- **GraphCLI** is a command line interface tool for building and deploying to The Graph.
- **GraphQL** is the query language use for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. The Graph uses GraphQL to query subgraphs.

### Developer Capabilities

- Engage with the entire subgraph lifecycle on the network, including publishing, querying and iterating on your custom subgraphs.
- Specialize in subgraph development, building open APIs for others to utilize and build on.
- Focus on application development by querying subgraphs deployed by other developers.

## Subgraph Specifics

### What are subgraphs?

A subgraph is a custom API built on blockchain data. It extracts data from a blockchain, process it, and stores it so that it can be easily queried via GraphQL.

A subgraph primarily consists of the following files:

- `subgraph.yaml`: this YAML file contains the subgraph manifest
- `subgraph.graphql`: this GraphQL schema defines what data is stored for your subgraph, and how to query it via GraphQL
- `AssemblyScript Mappings`: [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) code that translates from the event data to the entities defined in your schema

Learn the detailed specifics to [create a subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

### Subgraph Lifecycle

Here is a general view of a subgraph’s cycle:

### Subgraph Development

Subgraph development starts with local development and staging.

- You can use the same local setup whether you're building for The Graph Network or a local Graph Node.
  - You can leverage `graph-cli` and `graph-ts` to build your subgraph.
- You are encouraged to use tools such as [Matchstick](https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick) for unit testing to improve the robustness of your subgraphs.

> Only subgraphs on [supported networks](/developing/supported-networks/) will earn indexing rewards. Subgraphs that fetch data from IPFS are also **not** eligible.

## Deploy to Subgraph Studio

Once defined, a subgraph can be built and deployed to [Subgraph Studio](/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio/). In Subgraph Studio, you can do the following:

- Verify that your subgraph doesn't have any indexing errors and works as expected.
- Use its staging environment to index the deployed subgraph and make it available for review.

Learn how to [deploy subgraphs](/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio/).

## Publish to the Network

When you are happy with your subgraph, you can publish it to The Graph Network.

- This is an on-chain action, which registers the subgraph and makes it discoverable by Indexers.
- Published subgraphs have a corresponding NFT, which is then easily transferable.
- Published subgraphs have associated metadata, which provides other network participants with useful context and information.

Learn how to [publish a subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/).

## Add Signal for Indexing

Published subgraphs are unlikely to be picked up by Indexers without signal. To encourage indexing you should add signal to your subgraph.

**What is signal?**

- Signal is locked GRT associated with a given subgraph. It indicates to indexers that a given subgraph will receive query volume and it contributes to the indexing rewards available for processing it.
- Third party Curators may also signal on a given subgraph, if they deem the subgraph likely to drive query volume.

Learn more about signaling and [curating](/network/curating/) on The Graph.

## Querying & Application Development

Once a subgraph has been processed by Indexers and is available for querying, you can start using your subgraph in your applications.

- You query subgraphs via a gateway, which forwards your queries to an Indexer who has processed the subgraph (paying query fees in GRT).
- In order to make queries, you must generate an API key, which can be done in [Subgraph Studio](/https://thegraph.com/studio/).
- This API key must be funded with GRT to pay query fees.
- You can set a maximum query fee to control their costs and limit your API key to a given subgraph or origin domain.
- Subgraph Studio provides you with data on your API key usage over time.
- You can express an Indexer preference to the gateway, such as preferring Indexers with fast query response or have up-to-date data. These controls are set in Subgraph Studio.

## Updating Subgraphs

To update your subgraph with bug fixes or new functionalities, initiate a transaction to point it to the new version. You can deploy new versions of your subgraphs to [Subgraph Studio](/https://thegraph.com/studio/) for development and testing.

- If you selected "auto-migrate" when you applied the signal, updating the subgraph will migrate any signal to the new version and incur a migration tax.
- This signal migration should prompt Indexers to start indexing the new version of the subgraph, so it should soon become available for querying.

## Deprecating Subgraphs

If you no longer need a published subgraph, then you will need to deprecate the subgraph.

- Deprecating a subgraph returns any signaled GRT to Curators.
- To deprecate a subgraph, see the [deprecating a subgraph guide](/network/developing/deprecating-a-subgraph/).

## Transferring Subgraph

You can transfer the ownership of a subgraph. To transfer subgraph ownership, see the [transfer subgraph guide](/transferring-subgraph-ownership/).

### Network Economics

As a developer, you can do any of the following:

- Lock up GRT to encourage indexing and the query subgraphs.
- Burn GRT whenever a subgraph is updated.
