title: Quick Start

This guide walks you through the basics of creating, deploying, publishing, and querying a subgraph on The Graph easily.

**Prerequisites for this guide:**

- A crypto wallet
- A smart contract address on the network of your choice
- A subgraph that will be indexing data from a [supported network](/developing/supported-networks/)
- An API key

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Install the Graph CLI

The Graph CLI is written in TypeScript, and you must have `node` and either `npm` or `yarn` installed to use it. Check for the most recent CLI version.

On your local machine, run one of the following commands:

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli@latest
```

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 2. Create your subgraph

If your contract has events, the `init` command will automatically create a scaffold of a subgraph.

#### Create via CLI

Use the following command to create a subgraph in Subgraph Studio using CLI: `init --product subgraph-studio`

#### **Create via Subgraph Studio**

Subgraph Studio is a review and staging environment where you can create, manage, deploy, and publish subgraphs and API Keys.

1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and connect your wallet.
2. Click “Create a Subgraph." It is recommended to name the subgraph in Title Case: "Subgraph Name Chain Name."

For additional information on subgraph creation and CLI, see [Creating a Subgraph](developing/creating-a-subgraph).

### 3. Initialize Your Subgraph

#### **From an existing contract**

The following command initializes your subgraph from an existing contract:

```sh
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

> _Note: If your contract was verified on Etherscan, then the ABI will automatically be created in the CLI._

You can find commands for your specific subgraph on the subgraph page in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

When you initialize your subgraph, the CLI tool will ask you for the following information:

- Protocol: Choose the protocol your subgraph will be indexing data from
- Subgraph slug: Create a name for your subgraph. Your subgraph slug is an identifier for your subgraph.
- Directory to create the subgraph in: Choose your local directory
- Ethereum network(optional): You may need to specify which EVM-compatible network your subgraph will be indexing data from
- Contract address: Locate the smart contract address you’d like to query data from
- ABI: If the ABI is not auto-populated, you will need to input it manually as a JSON file
- Start Block: You should input the start block to optimize subgraph indexing of blockchain data. Locate the start block by finding the block where your contract was deployed.
- Contract Name: Input the name of your contract
- Index contract events as entities: It is suggested that you set this to true, as it will automatically add mappings to your subgraph for every emitted event
- Add another contract(optional): You can add another contract.

See the following screenshot for an example for what to expect when initializing your subgraph:

### 4. Write your subgraph

The `init` command in the previous step creates a scaffold subgraph that you can use as a starting point to build your subgraph.

When making changes to the subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (`subgraph.yaml`)- defines what datasources your subgraphs will index.
- Schema (`schema. graphql`) - defines what data you wish to retrieve from the subgraph.
- AssemblyScript Mappings (`mapping.ts`) - translates data from your datasources to the entities defined in the schema.

For a detailed breakdown on how to write your subgraph, check out [Creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

### 5. Deploy to your subgraph

Remember, deploying is not the same as publishing.

- When you deploy a subgraph, you push it to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), where you can test, stage and review it.
- When you publish a subgraph, you are publishing it onchain to the decentralized network.

1. Once your subgraph is written, run the following commands:

   ```sh
   $ graph codegen
   $ graph build
   ```

2. Authenticate and deploy your subgraph. The deploy key can be found on the Subgraph page in Subgraph Studio.

   ```sh
   $ graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
   $ graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
   ```

- The CLI will ask for a version label.
  - It's strongly recommended to use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning like `0.0.1.` That said, you can choose any string as version such as: `v1, version1, asdf`.

### 6. Review your subgraph

If you’d like to examine your subgraph before publishing it to the network, you can use [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to do the following:

- Run a sample query.
- Analyze your subgraph in the dashboard to check information.
- Check the logs on the dashboard to see if there are any errors with your subgraph.
- The logs of an operational subgraph will look like this:

### 7. Publish Your Subgraph to The Graph

Publishing a subgraph to the decentralized network makes it available for [Curators](/network/curating/) to begin curating it and [Indexers](/network/indexing/) to index it.

#### Publishing with Subgraph Studio

1. To publish your subgraph, click the publish button in the dashboard.
2. Select the network to which you would like to publish your subgraph.
   - Subgraphs are published to Arbitrum One to take advantage of the [faster transaction speeds and lower gas costs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq/).

#### Publishing from the CLI

As of version 0.73.0, you can also publish your subgraph with the [`graph-cli`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/tree/main/packages/cli).

1. Open the `graph-cli`.
2. Use the following commands: `graph codegen && graph build` then `graph publish`.
3. A window will open, allowing you to connect your wallet, add metadata, and deploy your finalized subgraph to a network of your choice.

To customize your deployment see [publishing a subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/)

#### Adding signal to your subgraph

1. To attract indexers to query your subgraph, you should add GRT curation signal to it.

   - This action improves quality of service, reduces latency, and enhances network redundancy and availability for your subgraphs.

2. If eligible for indexing rewards, Indexers receive GRT rewards based on the signaled amount.

   - It’s recommended to curate at least 3,000 GRT to attract 3 Indexers. Check reward eligibility based on subgraph feature usage and supported networks.

To learn more about curation, read [Curating](/network/curating/).

To save on gas costs, you can curate your subgraph in the same transaction you publish it by selecting this button:

### 8. Query Your Subgraph

Now, you can query your subgraph by sending GraphQL queries to your subgraph’s Query URL, which you can find by clicking the query button.

For more information about querying data from your subgraph, read [Querying The Graph](/querying/querying-the-graph/).
