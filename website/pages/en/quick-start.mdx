title: Quick Start
---

This guide walks you through the basics of creating, deploying, publishing, and querying a subgraph on The Graph easily.

**Prerequisites for this guide:**

- A crypto wallet
- A smart contract address on the network of your choice
- A subgraph that will be indexing data from a [supported network](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/supported-networks/)
- An API key

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Install the Graph CLI

The Graph CLI is written in TypeScript, and you must have `node` and either `npm` or `yarn` installed to use it. Check for the most recent CLI version.

On your local machine, run one of the following commands:

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli@latest
```

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 2. Create your subgraph

Once CLI is installed, you can use the `graph init` command to set up a new subgraph from an existing contact.

If you already have a smart contract deployed to your preferred network, you can bootstrap a new subgraph from that contract to get started.

- If your contract has events, the `init` command will automatically create a scaffold of a subgraph

#### Create via CLI

Use the following command to create a subgraph in Subgraph Studio using CLI: `init --product subgraph-studio`

#### **Create via Subgraph Studio**

Subgraph Studio is a review and staging environment where you can create, manage, deploy, and publish subgraphs and API Keys.

1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and connect your wallet.
2. Click “Create a Subgraph." It is recommended to name the subgraph in Title Case: "Subgraph Name Chain Name."

For additional information on subgraph creation and CLI, see [Creating a Subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/docs/blob/main/developing/creating-a-subgraph).

### 3. Initialize Your Subgraph

#### **From an existing contract**

The following command initializes your subgraph from an existing contract:

```jsx
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

> _Note: If your contract was verified on Etherscan, then the ABI will automatically be created in the CLI._

You can find commands for your specific subgraph on the subgraph page in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

When you initialize your subgraph, the CLI tool will ask you for the following information:

- Protocol: Choose the protocol your subgraph will be indexing data from
- Subgraph slug: Create a name for your subgraph. Your subgraph slug is an identifier for your subgraph.
- Directory to create the subgraph in: Choose your local directory
- Ethereum network(optional): You may need to specify which EVM-compatible network your subgraph will be indexing data from
- Contract address: Locate the smart contract address you’d like to query data from
- ABI: If the ABI is not auto-populated, you will need to input it manually as a JSON file
- Start Block: You should input the start block to optimize subgraph indexing of blockchain data. Locate the start block by finding the block where your contract was deployed.
- Contract Name: Input the name of your contract
- Index contract events as entities: It is suggested that you set this to true, as it will automatically add mappings to your subgraph for every emitted event
- Add another contract(optional): You can add another contract.

See the following screenshot for an example for what to expect when initializing your subgraph:

### **4. Configure your subgraph**

The `init` command in the previous step creates a scaffold subgraph that you can use as a starting point to build your subgraph.

When making changes to the subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (`subgraph.yaml`)- defines what datasources your subgraphs will index.
- Schema (`schema. graphql`) - defines what data you wish to retrieve from the subgraph.
- AssemblyScript Mappings (`mapping.ts`) - translates data from your datasources to the entities defined in the schema.

For a detailed breakdown on how to build your subgraph, check out [Creating a Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

### **5. Deploy to your subgraph**

Remember, deploying is not the same as publishing.

- When you deploy a subgraph, you push it to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), where you can test, stage and review it.
- When you publish a subgraph, you are publishing it onchain to the decentralized network.

1. Once your subgraph is written, run the following commands:

```jsx
$ graph codegen
$ graph build
```

1. Authenticate and deploy your subgraph. The deploy key can be found on the Subgraph page in Subgraph Studio.

```jsx
$ graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
$ graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>`
```

- The CLI will ask for a version label.
  - It's strongly recommended to use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning like `0.0.1.` That said, you can choose any string as version such as: `v1, version1, asdf`.

### 6. Review your subgraph

If you’d like to examine your subgraph before publishing it to the network, you can use Subgraph Studio to do the following:

- Run a sample query
- Analyze your subgraph in the dashboard to check information
- Check the logs on the dashboard to see if there are any errors with your subgraph.
- The logs of an operational subgraph will look like this:

![Subgraph logs](/img/subgraph-logs-image.png)

### 7. Publish Your Subgraph to The Graph

Publishing a subgraph to the decentralized network makes it available for [Curators](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/curating/) to begin curating it and [Indexers](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/indexing/) to index it.

Learn more about curating and indexing on The Graph.

#### **Publish with CLI**

As of version `0.73.0`, you can also publish your subgraph with the graph-cli.

1. After running `graph build && graph codegen,` type "graph publish.”
2. A window will open to connect your wallet, add metadata, and deploy your finalized subgraph to a network of your choice.

(Optional) You can also upload your build to a specific IPFS node and further customize your deployment with the following flags:

```
USAGE
  $ graph publish [SUBGRAPH-MANIFEST] [-h] [-i <value>] [--ipfs-hash <value>] [--webapp-url <value>]

FLAGS
  -h, --help            Show CLI help.
  -i, --ipfs=<value>    [default: <https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/api/v0>] Upload build results to an IPFS node.
  --ipfs-hash=<value>   IPFS hash of the subgraph manifest to deploy.
  --webapp-url=<value>  [default: <https://cli.thegraph.com/publish>] URL of the web UI you want to use to deploy.

```

#### **Publish with Subgraph Studio**

1. To publish your subgraph, click the publish button in the dashboard.
2. Select the network to which you would like to publish your subgraph. 1. Subgraphs will be published to Arbitrum One to take advantage of the [faster transaction speeds and lower gas costs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq/). ![Subgraph publish](/img/publish-and-signal-tx.png)

#### **Adding signal to your subgraph**

1. To attract indexers to query your subgraph, you should add GRT curation signal to it.
   1. This action improves quality of service, reduces latency, and enhances network redundancy and availability for your subgraphs.
2. If eligible for indexing rewards, Indexers receive GRT rewards based on the signaled amount.
   1. It’s recommended to curate at least 3,000 GRT to attract 3 Indexers. Check reward eligibility based on subgraph feature usage and supported networks.

To learn more about curation, read [Curating](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/curating/).

> To save on gas costs, you can curate your subgraph in the same transaction you publish it by selecting this button:
>
> - After publishing your subgraph, it’s essential to know how to manage it regularly.

- Remember, you can't publish your subgraph to the network if it hasn't finished syncing.
  - This usually happens when the subgraph has bugs; the logs will show you where those issues are.

### 8. Query Your Subgraph

Now, you can query your subgraph by sending GraphQL queries to your subgraph’s Query URL, which you can find by clicking the query button.

- If you don't have your API key, you can query via the free, rate-limited development query URL, which can be used for development and staging.

For more information about querying data from your subgraph, read [Querying The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/).
